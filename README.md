### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>
Hi, I’m [**Mahya Madelta**](https://www.youtube.com/@giadev), a high school student with a strong focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, especially their application in AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things).

I enjoy hands-on development and spend a lot of time understanding how algorithms actually work, not just using them as black boxes.

AI and Machine Learning projects for practical use cases

AIoT-related experiments combining IoT, data, and ML models

School projects, competitions, and independent explorations

Developing [mnzproject](https://github.com/mahyamadelta/mnzproject), a platform designed for scrolling and exploring scientific journals and academic articles

Programming Languages
- Python
- C++
- Basic Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

AI, Data & IoT
- Machine Learning (model building & experimentation)
- Data processing and analysis
- IoT-based projects and integrations
I’m still learning, but I can work independently and explain concepts to others when needed.
